    "# Project 4 - Prisoner's Dilemma\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is about a simple two-player game.  In the game each player has only two choices: they can **cooperate** or **cheat**.  They choose secretly, so they do not know what their opponent will do. Each player gets a score (or \"payoff\") as follows:\n",
    " - if both players cheat, they both get 0 points\n",
    " - if both players cooperate, they both get 2 points\n",
    " - if one player cooperates and one player cheats, the one who cheats gets 3 points and the one who cooperates gets -1 points.\n",
    "\n",
    "The game is played several times and whoever has the most points at the end is the winner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many different versions of this game exist, and they form a fundamental example in [game theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project you will investigate how well various strategies do when they play this game.  You will simulate games with just two players as well as \"tournaments\" where many different players all play each other. Finally you will investigate the results of changing the payoffs on how well strategies perform. \n",
